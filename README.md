this all i have studied from the diffrent sourses like (youtube, cousers, udemy) and using other internet sourses
in this basically a proper basics foundation is there

If anyone seeing this then make sure first you have to learn from tutorial and then you can use this for practise 
in this complete basics/intermediate is involved

guy's make sure to use jupyter notebook for practise(it does not give any reccomendation of code so everything you need to do yourself this helps you to get better hands on)
